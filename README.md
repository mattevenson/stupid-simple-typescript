every time i try googling "typescript starter template" i get some repo with 1.9k stars that gets updated every week with a different build system / linter / git commit hook.

i'm sorry i just want to write 100 lines of javascript but i hate javascrpt so i'm writing typescript and i don't need 15 npm packages to do that.

so i made this.
